## How it works

* This Obituary Scraper is an app that lets users scrape all the recent obituaries posted in the [Altoona Mirror Obituaries](http://www.altoonamirror.com/obituaries/) section of their website.

* When a user clicks on a person's name, they can add notes about that obtiuary. 

* User's can also click on the link associated with that scraped obit and go to that individual's published obituary.

* The app stores the obits and the notes in a MongoDB database connected through Mongoose.

* The app is deployed using Heroku.
